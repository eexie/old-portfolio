Science Expo is the largest student-run organization in Canada, connecting youth to the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) community. Since last summer, I have been working with them as the graphic designer and occasionally the IT consultant. 

One of my major tasks last year was creating all of the promotional graphics for our annual flagship conference. Last year's conference was named Synapse. 

This July, I also redesigned and built the main website: <a href="http://science-expo.org/" target="_blank"> science-expo.org </a>
