<p>During my second co-op term at the Canon Innovation Lab (September - December 2016), I spent 4 weeks working on the a virtual reality game, the Camera Simulator. The game allows players to try out select Canon camera bodies in combination with different lenses in a virtual environment, complete with the ability to adjust camera settings like ISO, aperture or shutter speed, and see their effects in real time in the photos taken. </p>
<br>
<p>In my 4 weeks on the project, I mainly worked on feature parity with the new Oculus Touch controllers. I worked on porting features like the camera menu functionalities, calibrating the exposure calculations, as well as introducing new features such as navigating the scene with the touch controller triggers, picking up physical models of the lenses and camera bodies with the controllers and attaching them to create a functional camera. I also 3D modelled the 3 lenses currently on the game, the 24-105mm, 50mm, and 70-200mm.</p>

<!--<p>We envision this game to be used in both retail and personal applications. For example, a user might be interested in trying out a certain camera before they purchase, but the electronics store near them don't have the specific model in stock. They can try out the simulator in store and gain access to a multitude of different camera equipment virtually before committing to purchase. The game can also be used for photography education, because players can experiment with camera settings and see a realistic simulation of their effects, which will educate them on properly exposing shots of their environment.</p>

<p>The game is currently released for free on Steam.</p>
